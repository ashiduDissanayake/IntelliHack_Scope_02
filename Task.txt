Customer Segmentation

Overview:
You are given a dataset containing data about customer behavior on an e-commerce platform. The dataset includes information about customer interactions, purchases, and browsing patterns. Your task is to identify distinct customer segments (clusters) based on their behavior.

Dataset Features:
- customer_id: Unique identifier for the customer.
- total_purchases: Total number of purchases made by the customer.
- avg_cart_value: Average value of items in the customer's cart (in monetary units).
- total_time_spent: Total time spent on the platform (in minutes).
- product_click: Number of products viewed by the customer.
- discount_count: Number of times the customer used a discount code.

Hidden Clusters:
The dataset contains 3 distinct customer segments:

1. Bargain Hunters
   - total_purchases: High (frequent purchases)
   - avg_cart_value: Low (they buy cheaper items)
   - total_time_spent: Moderate (they spend some time browsing but focus on purchasing)
   - product_click: Moderate (they view a reasonable number of products)
   - discount_count: High (they frequently use discount codes)
   - Behavior: These customers are deal-seekers who make frequent purchases of low-value items and heavily rely on discounts.

2. High Spenders
   - total_purchases: Moderate (they make fewer but high-value purchases)
   - avg_cart_value: High (they buy expensive items)
   - total_time_spent: Moderate (they spend time browsing but focus on high-value items)
   - product_click: Moderate (they view a reasonable number of products)
   - discount_count: Low (they rarely use discount codes)
   - Behavior: These customers are premium buyers who focus on high-value purchases and are less influenced by discounts.

3. Window Shoppers
   - total_purchases: Low (they make very few purchases)
   - avg_cart_value: Moderate (they view items of varying prices)
   - total_time_spent: High (they spend a lot of time browsing)
   - product_click: High (they view a large number of products)
   - discount_count: Low (they rarely use discount codes)
   - Behavior: These customers spend significant time browsing but rarely make purchases.

Goal:
Identify and clearly visualize the separations between these clusters.
